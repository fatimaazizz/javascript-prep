# Scope
**scoping** controls how our program's variables are organized and accessed by the JavaScript engine.So basically scoping asks the question,where do variables live?
Or where can we access a certain variable and where not?
  
## lexical scoping
 Javascript uses lexical scoping  in which  Scoping is controled by the **placement** of functions and blocks in the code.
 
 **For example**, a function that is written insideanother function has access to the variablesof the parent function, okay?
