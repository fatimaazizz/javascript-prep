## defination
Javascript is a High Level , Oject-Oriented, Multi-Paragigm Rograming Language.\
## Deeply Explained
JavaScript is a high-level, prototype-based,object-oriented, multi-paradigm,interpreted or just-in-time compiled , dynamic, single-threaded, garbage-collected programming language with first-class functions and a non-blocking event loop concurrency model.
## High Level 
Every progarm in computer need resources like hard-ware such as memory and CPU\
In Low level language **Developer has to maintein these resources**. LIKE C\
In High Level language **Developer don't need to worry  every happens automatically** LIKE Python and javacsript.\
**PROS** of High level language Easy to learn and use.\
**CRONS**  program will not be as fast and optimze.
## Grabage-Collection
 one of powerful tool which takes memory managment away from us developers is garbage-collection which is basically an alogrithum inside javascript engine , which automatically removes old,unused objects from coumputer memory in order not to clog it up with unneccessary stuff.
 ## Interpreted or just-in-time compiled
 Computer system only understand  0 and 1 every program have to be written in machine code.
