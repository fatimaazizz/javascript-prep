## defination
Javascript is a High Level , Oject-Oriented, Multi-Paragigm Rograming Language.\
## Deeply Explained
JavaScript is a high-level, prototype-based,object-oriented, multi-paradigm,interpreted or just-in-time compiled , dynamic, single-threaded, garbage-collected programming language with first-class functions and a non-blocking event loop concurrency model.
## High Level 
Every progarm in computer need resources like hard-ware such as memory and CPU\
In Low level language **Developer has to maintein these resources**. LIKE C\
In High Level language **Developer don't need to worry  every happens automatically** LIKE Python and javacsript.\
**PROS** of High level language Easy to learn and use.\
**CRONS**  program will not be as fast and optimze.
## Grabage-Collection
 one of powerful tool which takes memory managment away from us developers is garbage-collection which is basically an alogrithum inside javascript engine , which automatically removes old,unused objects from coumputer memory in order not to clog it up with unneccessary stuff.
 ## Interpreted or just-in-time compiled
 Computer system only understand  0 and 1 every program have to be written in machine code.which is  imposible for us to write. we write code in javscript human readable languag. it comiles at the runtime.
 ## Paradigm
 An Pproach and mindset of structing code , which  will direct coding style and techniques.
1. procedural programing 
2. object-oriented programing 
3. functional programing
## prototype-based object-oriented
Every thing in javascript is  an object accept the premitive values such as number ,bolean ,strings\
but ,array  are objects.

## first-class fuctions
functions are treated as **varaible** in javascript.we can pass it from one function to an other function  and return them.

## Dynamic
1. no data type defination .types become known at the runtime 
2. Data type of variable is automaticallly changed
## Concurrency model
how the javaScript engine handles multiple tasks happening at the time.
### why we need it?
javascript runs in one single thread, so it can do one thing at a time./
**so long runing task** will block the execution of the other tasks.
we want not blocking beahvior/
### how to acheive that?
by usingh an **event loop** : takke long running task ,executes them in the "background" and puts them back in the main thread once  they are finished
